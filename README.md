Made in conjunction with Code Platoon, Echo Cohort

We hosted this app on a private repo. This public version is cleaned up and partly refactored. 

To run:

1) download exp cli
2) `yarn` to install modules
3) run `exp start --lan` in top directory
4) run `exp ios` in top directory, different terminal window

notes:
app functions on ios in simulator and on device; however, android does not work well do to issues with the Expo API and obtaining device contacts.
